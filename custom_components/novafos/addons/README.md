# INSTALLING

Copy the novafos-login directory to /confgi/addons/ .

  * In Home Assistant go to "Configuration", click the "Add-ons", click "add-on-store" in the bottom right corner.
  * Next in thr top right oveflow menu click the "Check for updates" button.  Select from the "Local addons" this add-on.  
  * Install the add-on
  * Start the add-on
  * Check the logs that it is started

  NOTE: This is very experimental, and any help in making it work as an add-on in Home Assistant is appreciated.
    The code runs as-is in an external docker host, so it "should" work (famous last words)...
